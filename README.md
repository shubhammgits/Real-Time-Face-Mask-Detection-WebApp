# Face Mask Detection Web Application

A modern, real-time face mask detection web application built with Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. This application provides both image upload and live camera detection capabilities with a sleek dark glassmorphism UI.

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a comprehensive face mask detection system that combines deep learning with an intuitive web interface. The application can detect whether individuals are wearing masks in real-time through webcam feeds or uploaded images, making it perfect for health compliance monitoring in various environments.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Camera Detection**: Live webcam feed with instant mask detection
- **Image Upload & Analysis**: Drag-and-drop image upload with batch processing
- **High Accuracy Detection**: 99.2%+ accuracy using MobileNetV2 architecture
- **Modern UI Design**: Dark glassmorphism theme with cyan blue accents
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Privacy-First**: All processing done locally - images never leave your device
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Optimized for real-time performance

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Modern glassmorphism design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **JavaScript**: Async/await patterns for smooth user interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints

### Backend
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning model inference
- **OpenCV**: Face detection and image processing
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations

### Deep Learning Model
- **Base Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Custom Layers**: 
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D
  - BatchNormalization
  - Dropout layers (0.5 and 0.3)
  - Dense layers with ReLU and Softmax activation
- **Training Strategy**: Two-phase training with transfer learning
- **Dataset**: ~18,500 images from combined Kaggle datasets

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Face Detection Pipeline
- **Input Processing**: Images/video frames are captured and preprocessed
- **Face Detection**: Haar Cascade classifier identifies faces in the image
- **Region Extraction**: Face regions are extracted and normalized to 224x224 pixels
- **Classification**: MobileNetV2 model predicts mask/no-mask with confidence scores
- **Output Rendering**: Results displayed with bounding boxes and labels

### 2. Model Training Process
The underlying model was trained using a sophisticated two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Feature Extraction**
- Freeze MobileNetV2 base layers
- Train custom top layers (10 epochs)
- Learn domain-specific features

**Phase 2: Fine-tuning**
- Unfreeze deeper layers
- Lower learning rate fine-tuning (20 epochs)
- Optimize for mask detection specifics

**Optimizations Applied:**
- EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting
- ReduceLROnPlateau for adaptive learning
- ModelCheckpoint to save best weights
- Data augmentation (flips, rotations, zoom)
